My original end goal for my spinoff game of danganronpa was very ambitious and maybe a little too ambitious, but even though I couldn't make a safe code that the player would have to type into a key pad, or I couldn't create the completed game I had invisioned, I'm still proud of the end product that had come out of pretty much a months worth of code even though I had to cut corners when it came to my initial ideas for the game like instead of a safe its a locked door and originally I was hoping to have momokuma kill a student to pressure the player to keep trying to get out.
My final product like I said is incomplete because I was hoping that I could have enough time to have two different ways to win making nagito's method of collecting keys being the only way of winning that actually works, but I was hoping that hajime's method of collecting hope fragments would also be a form of escape
For the time, skill set, and the amount of progress I made coding the game, really makes me proud of my final product because even though its far from complete, the amount of code I was able to put in with only 2 semesters worth of coding knowledge (online semesters at that) and only a little less than a month to complete the project makes me happy with my end result.
I probably ended up with the results I have because of the obstacles that had been set in place since the beginning of this school year so because of that I'm going easy on myself because I know that I would have done better in person because the necessary equipment is there with compilers that won't goof up because of the wifi connection.
The things I learned with this project were having better understandings of things like extra code files, implementing sprites that have animations, and the one I think I should know which is printing text to the screen, but I've also developed better planning skills so that I could give myself structure as well as better time management, so I could prioritize more important things and come back to the less important things.
Now I probably won't come back to the project for two reasons, number 1 being I don't want to break my code when I'm already at the finishline I set for myself, and number 2 being because I want my future self to maybe come accross the code and look at how far I've come and maybe in the future when I know a lot more about coding I might making a little side project for myself to complete the game.
With the lessons I've learned through trial and error with this project, I'd say something I could do differently is being more organized with what and when I code something as well as think to myself possible way of coding something I have an idea of instead of thinking of something cool and realize last second that I have no idea how to code the idea.
